## Engineering Philosophy: First Principles Approach

### What are First Principles?

First principles thinking involves breaking down complex problems into their most fundamental, verifiable truths and building solutions from the ground up. In aerospace engineering, this means:

- **Starting with fundamental physics laws** (Newton's laws, thermodynamic principles, conservation of energy/momentum)
- **Building complex systems** from basic equations and relationships
- **Avoiding assumptions** or "black box" approaches
- **Validating every step** against known engineering principles

### Application in TurbineJetSim

This project exemplifies first principles engineering through:

#### 1. Thermodynamic Foundation
- **Brayton Cycle Analysis**: Implementation starts with basic thermodynamic relations
  - First Law: dE = δQ - δW (Energy conservation)
  - Second Law: dS ≥ δQ/T (Entropy considerations)
  - Ideal Gas Law: PV = nRT
  - Isentropic Relations: P₁V₁^γ = P₂V₂^γ

#### 2. Momentum Theory
- **Thrust Calculation**: Derived from Newton's Second Law
  - F = ma = ṁ(V_exit - V_inlet)
  - Pressure thrust: F_pressure = (P_exit - P_ambient) × A_exit
  - Total thrust: F_total = F_momentum + F_pressure

#### 3. Component-Level Analysis
- **Compressor**: Work input calculations from compression ratios
- **Combustor**: Energy addition from fuel heating value
- **Turbine**: Work extraction to drive compressor
- **Nozzle**: Expansion and acceleration analysis
